A simple weather app built with React and powered by the OpenWeatherMap API.  
**This project was created as part of practicing and improving my ReactJS skills.**

- Clean and responsive user interface.
- Built using React and Vite for fast development.

## Prerequisites ⚙️

- **npm** or **yarn** for package management

## Installation 🚀
### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adithyandileep/react-weather-app.git

npm install
```

### Create an API key
1. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) if you haven't already.
2. Generate an API key from your account.

### Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:
```env
